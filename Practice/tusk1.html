    <p1>A vehicle (from Latin vehiculum)[1] is a machine designed for self-propulsion, 
        usually to transport people, cargo, or both. The term "vehicle" typically refers
        to ground transport vehicles such as human-powered land vehicles (e.g. bicycles
        , tricycles, velomobiles), animal-powered transports 
        (e.g. horse-drawn carriages/wagons, ox carts, dog sleds), motor vehicles
        (e.g. motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses, mobility scooters)
        and railed vehicles (trains, trams and monorails),
        but more broadly also includes cable transport (cable cars and elevators), 
        watercraft (ships, boats and underwater vehicles), amphibious vehicles 
        (e.g. screw-propelled vehicles, hovercraft, seaplanes), 
        aircraft (airplanes, helicopters, gliders and aerostats)
        and space vehicles (spacecraft, spaceplanes and launch vehicles).[2]</p1><br>

        

        <br><p1>It is estimated by historians that boats have been used 
        since prehistory; rock paintings depicting boats
        dated from around 50,000 to 15,000 BC, were found in Australia.[4] 
        The oldest boats found by archaeological excavation are logboats,
        with the oldest logboat found, the Pesse canoe found in a bog in the 
        Netherlands, being carbon dated to 8040–7510 BC, making it 9,500–10,000 
        years old,[5][6][7][8] A 7,000 year-old seagoing boat made from reeds and
        tar has been found in Kuwait.[9] Boats were used between 4000 -3000 BC in 
        Sumer,[10] ancient Egypt[11] and in the Indian Ocean.[10] </p1>
